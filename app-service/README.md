# Backend Setup Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the backend setup guide for our application. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get the backend server up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Installation

In your terminal.
Navigate to the 'app-service' directory.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

Starting the Server
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server by running the following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

This command will start the backend server on port 3500.

## Additional Notes

Ensure that no other application is running on port 3500 before starting the server.

This part of project is still under construction. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback.
