# Running both client and server
- Due to browser security features, you cannot run the client and server from different domains (i.e. different localhost ports)
- This shouldn't be an issue when they're both hosted on the web
- Get around this in a dev environment by installing Moesif Origin & CORS Changer (or similar) browser extension
